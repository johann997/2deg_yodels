# 2deg_yodels

## Overview
An easy-to-install, open-source application that allows users to upload a .dxf file and calculate the electric potential from user-determined gate voltages. KWANT is used to calculate transport properties by applying a tight-binding approximation. A tight-binding model reduces computation so that users can simulate pinch-off or charge stability diagrams in ‘real time’.
